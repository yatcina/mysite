CHAPTER 3
IN the Spring of 1921, Robert began to make greater
progress in his studies, which greatly encouraged
his chum, Walter Kennelworth. Robert would study
and read early and late. Walter would often call on
him in his room and find him there deeply engrossed
reading the Bible and puzzling over the interpretation
of the meaning of many parts of the Scriptures.

One Sunday in the early part of June, Robert and
Walter went to church and the minister took for his
text 1 Cor. 13: 2, “And though I have the gift of
prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge;
and though I have all faith, so that I could remove
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.” Then
the minister read from the 7th verse, “Beareth all
things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things,” and again from the 11th verse, “When I
was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put
away childish things.” The minister further read from
the 13th verse, “And now abideth faith, hope, love, these
three; but the greatest of these is love.” Again he
read from 2 Cor. 5: 7, “For we walk by faith, not by
sight," and concluded the reading of the text from Gal.
5: 14, "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in
this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
