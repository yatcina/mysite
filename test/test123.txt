My father and brother opposed me because they did not understand
me.

I firmly believe that the Bible and the Scriptures contain
the key to all knowledge, and that all a man has to do is to
seek and he shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto him.
I believe it is best for me to go away to New York as soon
as I can, away from my own people, for the good book says:

"A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country,
and in his own house."

The Bible points the way to read the signs and the stars.
St. Matthew 12: 38, 39 and 40 --

"Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered,
saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee."

"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there
shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas:"

"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the
whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth."

I have read the Book of Jonah thru very carefully, and I
believe that I understand what the Saviour meant when he
said:

"No sign shall be given, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas."

I believe there was a secret meaning in what he said; that
the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth. I believe that a man who understands the meaning
of that has all the power under heaven and earth, as the
Bible says he shall have. I believe that that is the key to
the interpretation of the future. I am sure I have found it
and know how to apply it.

I do not wish to burden you further with this long letter,
Mr. Kennelworth.
