YESTERDAY 

Dreams -- just dreams of yesterday,
When love to me was sweet,
Romance has now gone astray,
No other love will I greet.

It was short -- my little romance,
Short -- but God -- how good!
Went along as smooth as a dance,
Part us? It seemed no one could.

But someone did -- tho' I forgive,
He loved her as did I,
For her only -- did I live,
And now -- for her I'd die!
